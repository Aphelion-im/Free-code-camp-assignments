# Note about Package.json

The included package.json contains all the assignments from this section.

The Repl server should be started with "npm start" and not with the Repl Run button, otherwise Free Code Camp cannot see the solution and the served page will crash.

The Repl webserver url should look like this:
https://projectname.githubusername.repl.co
